# Turbo-Parakeet 

Turbo-Parakeet is an application designed for the Texas Tech University Cognitive Anthrozoology lab by a first-year Ph.D student. The concept is an interface between ordinary people and an API that enables users to analyze images of faces for emotion, managing to be both lightweight and simple to use. 

Create React App, Node.js, and Express will be used to create an IPFS application that allows a user to login, upload files (images of faces for now), pin those files to IPFS, retrieve the CID of each file, and then, at a rate of 20/minute or less, send each image to the SmartClick API (or other API in the future) and display the results returned from SmartClick to the user. The results will appear in a modal and a CSV file that the user can download. After the user logs off, the pins to IPFS documents are removed and the server cache is cleared - the application is reset and ready for the next user. No personal data has been compromised or leaked. 

## Relevant technologies:

Create React App: sets up React front end
Express: middleware
Node.js: Node backend
IPFS: image storage, image URL/CID generation
SmartClick Emotion Detection API: Reads emotion in images
(additional API): does something similar but hits non-SmartClick endpoint etc


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
