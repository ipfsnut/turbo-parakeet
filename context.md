# Turbo-Parakeet v.1 Context

## Project Overview

Turbo-Parakeet v.1 is a Netlify serverless React application. The project's GitHub repository can be found at: https://github.com/ipfsnut/turbo-parakeet/

## Netlify Documentation

- [Create React App on Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/frameworks/react/#create-react-app)
- [Frameworks Overview](https://docs.netlify.com/frameworks/)

## Build Settings

The typical build settings for Create React App projects on Netlify are:

- Build command: `npm run build` or `yarn build`
- Publish directory: `build`

## Project Structure

The agreed-upon directory structure for the Turbo-Parakeet v.1 application is as follows:


src/
App.js
components/
styles/
utils/
data/
public/
index.html
netlify/
functions/
edge-functions/
plugins/
README.md
netlify.toml


- `src/App.js`: The main entry point of the React application.
- `src/components/`: Directory for reusable components.
- `src/styles/`: Directory for CSS or SCSS files for styling.
- `src/utils/`: Directory for utility functions or helper modules.
- `src/data/`: Directory for data files or static data.
- `public/index.html`: The main HTML file for the React application.
- `netlify/functions/`: Directory for Netlify Functions (serverless functions).
- `netlify/edge-functions/`: Directory for Netlify Edge Functions (serverless functions running on Netlify's global network).
- `netlify/plugins/`: Directory for Netlify Build Plugins (plugins to extend the build process).
- `README.md`: Documentation and instructions for the project.
- `netlify.toml`: Configuration file for Netlify-specific settings.

## Additional Context

- The application will be built using Create React App and deployed to Netlify.
- Netlify Functions and potentially Edge Functions will be used to provide serverless functionality.
- Build Plugins may be utilized to extend the Netlify build process as needed.
- The application will be deployed to Netlify.

- The application will be deployed to Netlify.

## Completed Steps

1. Installed the following packages:
   - `netlify-cli`: Provides the Netlify CLI for local development and testing.
   - `@netlify/functions`: Required for creating and deploying Netlify Functions.
   - `react-dropzone`: A React component for creating drag-and-drop file upload zones (optional).

2. Current file tree structure:
node_modules/
package.json
package-lock.json
public/
index.html
src/
App.js
App.test.js
index.js

reportWebVitals.js
setupTests.js

# Setting up Netlify CLI in GitPod

To use the Netlify CLI and run the Netlify dev server within the GitPod environment, we needed to take a few extra steps since we apparently didn't get the netlify CLI installed in the GitPod environment on the first go-round.

So, we installed the Netlify CLI globally in the GitPod environment using the command: `npm install netlify-cli -g`

Next, We navigated to the project root directory: `cd /workspace/turbo-parakeet/turbo-parakeet`

Finally, we were able to start the Netlify dev server by running: `netlify dev`

Since this is a monorepo setup, the Netlify CLI prompted us to select the specific site/package to run the dev server for. After making the selection, the Netlify dev server started successfully, and we could access our Netlify Functions at `http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/[function-name]`.

By following these steps, we were able to set up and use the Netlify CLI within the GitPod environment, allowing us to test and develop our Netlify Functions locally before deploying.

# note from EpicDylan: I'm having to feed this Claude3 instance the docs from the websites where this is explained, but it seems to be doing an adequate job. my goal with this file is to keep it honest and track progress over time so that we can objectively evaluate the effectiveness of this copilot program. 



# Hypothesis and Approach

## Hypothesis
By integrating the React Dropzone component with a Netlify Function for file uploads, we can create a minimal working example that allows users to upload files, which will be temporarily stored in the Netlify serverless storage during the user's session.

## Approach
1. Install the React Dropzone package in the Create React App project.
2. Create a new Netlify Function file (e.g., `upload.js`) in the `functions` directory to handle file uploads and save them to the Netlify serverless storage.
3. Modify the `App.js` file to:
   - Import the Dropzone component from the react-dropzone package.
   - Add the Dropzone component to the JSX.
   - Implement a `handleFileDrop` function to handle dropped files.
   - Make a fetch request to the Netlify Function (created in step 2) from the `handleFileDrop` function, passing the dropped file data.
4. Test the integration locally using the Netlify dev server (`netlify dev`).

By following this approach, we aim to create a minimal working example that demonstrates the integration of the React Dropzone component with a Netlify Function for file uploads, allowing us to verify the setup and functionality before potentially integrating it into a more complex application structure.


# Progress Update

We have made significant progress in our effort to create a minimal working example that integrates the React Dropzone component with a Netlify Function for file uploads.

Specifically, we have created the `upload.js` file and placed it within the `functions` directory at the root of the project. This file contains the code for the Netlify Function that will handle file uploads and save them to the Netlify serverless storage during the user's session.

The `upload.js` file imports the necessary modules (`formidable` and `fs`) and defines an asynchronous `handler` function that will be executed when the Netlify Function is invoked. This function parses the incoming file upload data, copies the file to a temporary directory (`/tmp/`), and resolves or rejects a Promise based on the success or failure of the file upload process.

At this stage, we have successfully created the Netlify Function file without encountering any issues or explosions. The next step will be to modify the `App.js` file to include the React Dropzone component, implement the `handleFileDrop` function, and make a fetch request to the Netlify Function (`upload.js`) from the `handleFileDrop` function, passing the dropped file data.

By completing these remaining steps, we will have a minimal working example that demonstrates the integration of the React Dropzone component with a Netlify Function for file uploads, allowing us to verify the setup and functionality before potentially integrating it into a more complex application structure.
